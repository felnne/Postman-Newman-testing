# This is an Ansible inventory file. It inherits from /etc/ansible/hosts if it exists
# It organises hosts/nodes into logical groups which can then be used in playbooks

# This inventory is for the 'development' environment

# It is best practice to group hosts by location and purpose like so:

[vagrant-dev]
postman-newman-dev-node1.v.m

[vagrant:children]
vagrant-dev

[all-servers:children]
vagrant


[postman-newman-dev]
postman-newman-dev-node1.v.m

[postman-newman:children]
postman-newman-dev
